<h1>LVS defense strategies against DoS attack</h1>

<p>In the IPVS version 0.9.10 or later, an entry is created for each
new connection in order to keep its state (such as the server that new
connection is redirected to), and the size of each entry is 124 bytes
thus 128 bytes effective memory is needed for each entry. The
Denial-of-Service attck to the LVS host is to aggressively increase
the number of entries until the host run out of memory. Three defense
strategies are currently implemented against the kind of DoS
attack. They are the drop_entry defense, the drop_packet defense and
the secure_tcp defense. Those strategies are controlled by the sysctl
variables whether the one is effective or not in the kernel.

<h2>1. The drop_entry defense strategy</h2>

<p>The drop_entry defense is to randomly drop entries in the
connection hash table, just in order to collect back some memory for
new connections. In the current code, the drop_entry procedure can be
actived every second, then it randomly scans 1/32 of the whole and
drops entries that are in the SYN-RECV/SYNACK state, which should be
effective against syn-flooding attack. Since the tcp state transition
in the LVS is just determined by some flags of IP packets, it doesn't
verify TCP sequence numbers and it is not real tcp state transition,
the malicious attack can generate an SYN packet and then follow an ACK
packet, which can fool the LVS to put the entry in the ESTABLISHED
state.  For entries that are in the ESTABLISHED/UDP state, we use a
little more complicated drop mechanism. If the time to the last
received is less than 60 seconds, the entry is not dropped. If the
time is not less than 60 seconds, then the incoming packet counter of
the entry is considered, the entry is not dropped if the number of
incoming packets is larger than 8, for the entries whoes number of
incoming packets are from 2 to 8, the less the number is, the more
probility the entry is dropped.

<p>This strategy is controlled by the sysctl variable
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/drop_entry. The valid values are from 0 to 3,
where 0 means that this strategy is always disabled, 1 and 2 mean
automatic  modes (when there is no enough available memory, the
strategy is enabled and the variable is automatically set to 2,
otherwise  the strategy is disabled and the variable is set to 1), and
3 means that that the strategy is always enabled.

<p>We use the available memory threshold to determine if the system
has available memory. It can be changed by
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/amemthresh, the value is in memory page
unit. The default value is 1024 pages.

<h2>2. The drop_packet defense strategy</h2>

<p>If the LVS box is under the serve distributed DoS attack, the
drop_entry defense may not keep pace with the speed of connection
generation by the distributed DoS attack. The drop_packet defense is
designed to drop 1/rate packets before forwarding them to real
servers. If the rate is 1, then drop all the incoming packets.

<p>This strategy is controlled by the sysctl variable
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/drop_packet. The value definition is the same as
that of the drop_entry. In the automatic mode, the rate is determined
by the follow formula:

<blockquote>
rate = amemthresh / (amemthresh - available_memory)
</blockquote>

<p>when available memory is less than the available memory threshold.

<p>When the mode 3 is set, the always mode drop rate is controlled by
the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/am_droprate. The default value is 10.

<h2>3. The secure_tcp defense strategy</h2>

<p>The secure_tcp defense is to use a more complicated state
transtition table and some possible short timeouts of each state. In
the VS/NAT, it delays the entering the ESTABLISHED until the real
server starts to send data and ACK packet (after 3-way handshake).

<p>This strategy is controlled by the sysctl variable
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/secure_tcp. The value definition is the same as
the above ones.

<p>The timeout of secure tcp states can be tuned by the following
sysctl variables:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_close
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_closewait
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_established
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_finwait
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_icmp
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_lastack
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_listen
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_synack
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_synrecv
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_synsent
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_timewait
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/timeout_udp
</pre>
</blockquote>

In the secure_tcp defense, we recommand little timeout for the
SYN_RECV state such as 10 seconds or less. This state is used for
VS/NAT only when the secure_tcp variable is 2 or 3. For the
DR/TUN/LOCAL forwarding methods, the first state is SYN_ACK.
