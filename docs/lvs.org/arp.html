<h1>ARP problem in LVS/TUN and LVS/DR</h1>

<p>In the LVS/TUN and LVS/DR clusters, the Virtual IP (VIP) addresses
are shared by both the load balancer and real servers, because they
all configure the VIP address on one of their interfaces. In some
configurations that real servers are on the same network that the load
balancer accepts request packets, if real servers answers arp request
for the VIP, there will be race condition, no winner. Packets for the
VIP may be sent to the load balancer at one time, to a real server at
another time, to another real server at another time, and so on. Then,
connections will be broken, everything will be in a mess, and the
whole LVS cluster won't work. Therefore, in the LVS/TUN and LVS/DR
cluster, we must guarantee that only the load balancer answers arp
request for the VIP to accept incoming packets for virtual service,
and the real servers(in the same network of load balancer) don't
answer arp request for the VIP but can process packets destined for
the VIP locally.</p>

<p>Linux kernel 2.0.xx doesn't do arp response on loopback alias and
tunneling interfaces, it is good for the LVS cluster. However, Linux
kernel 2.2.xx does all arp responses of all its IP addresses except
the loopback addresses (127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0) and multicast
addresses. So, you will probably have problem in LVS/TUN or LVS/DR
cluster of real servers running kernel 2.2.xx with instructions
provided in other pages. After kernel 2.2.14, there is the "hidden"
flag available to make interfaces hidden from ARP broadcast, thank 
<a href="mailto:uli@linux.tu-varna.acad.bg">Julian Anastasov</a> and 
<a href="mailto:kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru">Alexey Kuznetsov</a> for adding
this nice ARP policy in the standard kernel!</p>

<h1>1. The hidden interface approach</h1>

<p>The configuration instructions to hide interface from ARP for LVS
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# Start the hiding interface functionality
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/hidden
# Hide all addresses for this interface
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/&lt;interface_name&gt;/hidden
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that once an interface is set hidden, all the addresses of the
interface is hidden from ARP broadcast and being included in the ARP
response of other addresses. So, it is not good to configure VIP on
the aliases of real Ethernet interfaces and make it hidden, unless you
have a unused Ethernet interface. 

<p>For LVS/DR clusters, it is good to configure VIPs on the aliases of
dummy or loopback device and hide the corresponding device. Then, you
can configure as many VIPs as you want. It is simple to configure, no
need to put more words here. :-)

<p>For LVS/TUN clusters, first you need to configure tunl0 device up,
then configure VIPs on the aliases of tunnel/dummy/loopback device and
hide that device. A configuration example is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# Insert the ipip module
insmod ipip
# Make the tunl0 device up
ifconfig tunl0 up
# Start the hiding interface functionality
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/hidden
# Hide all addresses for this tunnel device
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/tunl0/hidden
# Configure a VIP on an alias of tunnel device
ifconfig tunl0:0 &lt;VIP&gt; up
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that configuring the tunl0 device up is to make the kernel
decapsulate the received ipip packets correctly. Now, you can
configure as many VIPs as you want for LVS/TUN. Many thanks must go to
<a href="mailto:uli@linux.tu-varna.acad.bg">Julian</a> for all the
instructions.

<p>For the real servers running kernel 2.3.41 or later, you need apply
<a href="mailto:uli@linux.tu-varna.acad.bg">Julian</a>'s hidden patch
(hidden-2.3.41-1.diff) and rebuild
the kernel.

<h1>2. The redirect approach</h1>

<p>For LVS/DR clusters, <a href="mailto:horms@vergenet.net">Horms</a>
suggested a very cute redirect approach to get around the arp
problem.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have been able to get around this problem by removing the
interface alias on the real servers and setting up a redirect, using
ipchains of the form:

<pre>
ipchains -A input -j REDIRECT &lt;port&gt; -d &lt;virtual-ip-address&gt; &lt;port&gt; -p &lt;protocol&gt;
</pre>

<p>This has the down side that the real servers essentially have to be
Linux boxes to support this feature but it has the up side that the
Linux Director can easily be moved to any machine on the LAN as it
does not have to have an interface on a network other than the
LAN. This has important implications in being able to fail over the
Linux Director in a case of failure.
</blockquote>

For running multiple virtual services on a single VIP, you can specify
multiple redirect commands for different ports, or you don't supply a
port number so the comands could cover all ports in one hit per
protocol as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
ipchains -A  input -j REDIRECT -d &lt;VIP&gt; -p tcp
ipchains -A  input -j REDIRECT -d &lt;VIP&gt; -p udp
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>For LVS/TUN clusters, you can simply configure tunl0 up so that the
system can decapsulate ipip packets properly, then add the REDIRECT
commands for VIPs.

<h1>3. The policy routing approach</h1>

<a href="mailto:uli@linux.tu-varna.acad.bg">Julian</a> suggested to
use the advanced policy routing approach to get around the ARP problem
of the real servers. For example, 172.26.20.118 is the VIP address,
and the commands are as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
# Block  access from the  LAN to the  real server's VIP.  By
# this  way we ignore the router's ARP probes. The drawback:
# we  ignore the  client's probes too.   We have  to do this
# because the client on the LAN can receive replies from all
# real servers
ip rule add prio 99 from 172.26.20/24 table 99
ip route add table 99 blackhole 172.26.20.118

# Now  accept  locally  any  other  traffic,  i.e.  not from
# 172.26.20/24
ip rule add prio 100 table 100
ip route add table 100 local 172.26.20.118 dev lo
</pre>
</blockquote>

Policy routing is faster than transparent proxy, but the client on the
same LAN cannot access the virtual service on the VIP. The real
servers ignore the traffic from the LAN to the VIP, in order to
discard the ARP request for the VIP too.

<h1>4. Old patches making interfaces not to arp on kernel 2.2.13 or earlier</h1>

<p>Here are two patches to make loopback alias and tunneling
interfaces not do arp response in kernel 2.2. One is the 
sdw_fullarpfix.patch from <a
href="mailto:sdw@lig.net">Stephen D. Williams</a>; the other is 
arp_invisible-2213-2.diff (dated
1999/11/23) from <a href="mailto:uli@linux.tu-varna.acad.bg">Julian
Anastasov</a>.</p>

<p>Julian's ARP patch for kernel 2.2.13 adds the ability to configure
the dummy (local and tunnel too) interfaces as invisible to the ARP
queries and replies. It uses sysctl
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/arp_invisible to configure if an interface
is visible or not.  The default value of arp_invisible is 0 for
interfaces. If the value is set 1 for an interface, then the ARP
queries and replies for the interface will be skipped. The
configuration example is as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
# Global enable, you can use it only once
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_invisible
# Hide the interface and don't reply for it
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/&lt;interface_name&gt;/arp_invisible
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that you just need apply the arp patch to the kernel code of
real servers, needn't apply the ipvs patch on the real servers. Please
send any comments on these patches to<a
href="mailto:lvs-users@LinuxVirtualServer.org"> the LVS mailing
list</a>.</p>
