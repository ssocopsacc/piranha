<h1>The Local Node Feature</h1>

<p>This page contains information about the Local Node feature of
LinuxDirector.</p>

<p>If the local node feature is enabled, the load balancer can not
only redirect the packets of the specified port to the other servers
(remote nodes) to process it, but also can process the packets locally
(local node). Which node is chosen depends on the scheduling
algorithms. This local node feature can be used to build a virtual
server of a few nodes, for example, 2, 3 or more sites, in which it is
a resource waste if the load balancer is only used to redirect
packets. It is wise to direct some packets to the local node to
process. </p>

<p>This feature can also be used to build distributed identical
servers, in which one is too busy to handle requests locally, then it
can seamlessly forward requests to other serversto process them.This
feature can be applied to VS-NAT, VS-TUN and VS-DR.</p>

<p>To make a load balancer process a service locally, you just need to
add an entry in the virtual service, whose destination address is one
of the load balancer's IP addresses, 127.0.0.1 is often used for this
purpose.</p>

<p>Here is my configure example for testing virtual server via
tunneling. There is only one real server and a load balancer in the
cluster. The load balancer uses the VS-DR method to forward packets to
the real server, and the load balancer can also process some requests
for the virtual service. The configuration is as follows.</p>

<p>The load balancer (LinuxDirector), kernel 2.2.13</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>ifconfig eth0 172.26.20.111 netmask 255.255.255.0
    broadcast 172.26.20.255 up <br>
    route add -net 172.26.20.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0 <br>
    ifconfig eth0:0 172.26.20.110 netmask 255.255.255.255
    broadcast 172.26.20.110 up <br>
    route add -host 172.26.20.110 dev eth0:0 <br>
    ipvsadm -A -t 172.26.20.110:23 -s wlc<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t 172.26.20.110:23 -R 127.0.0.1<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t 172.26.20.110:23 -R 172.26.20.112 -g</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The real server 1, kernel 2.0.36 </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>ifconfig eth0 172.26.20.112 netmask 255.255.255.0
    broadcast 172.26.20.255 up <br>
    route add -net 172.26.20.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0 <br>
    ifconfig lo:0 172.26.20.110 netmask 255.255.255.255
    broadcast 172.26.20.110 up <br>
    route add -host 172.26.20.110 dev lo:0</p>
</blockquote>


<p>When two "telnet 172.26.20.110" commands are issued, one will
appear the login prompt of the load balancer, the other will appear
the login prompt of the real server.</p>
