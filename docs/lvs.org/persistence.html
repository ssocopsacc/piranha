<h1>Persistence Handling in LVS</h1>

<p>This page contains information about persistence handling in LVS
for sticky connection applications, such as http cookie, https, ftp,
and so on.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In the LVS cluster that we discuss in other documents, we have
assumed that each network connection is independent of every other
connection, so that each connection can be assigned to a server
independently of any past, present or future assignments. However,
there are times that two connections from the same client must be
assigned to the same server either for functional or for performance
reasons.</p>

<p>FTP is an example for a functional requirement for connection
affinity.  The client establishs two connections to the server, one is
a control connection (port 21) to exchange command information, the
other is a data connection (usually port 20) that transfer bulk
data. For active FTP, the client informs the server the port that it
listens to, the data connection is initiated by the server from the
server's port 20 and the client's port. LinuxDirector could examine
the packet coming from clients for the port that client listens to,
and create any entry in the hash table for the coming data
connection. But for passive FTP, the server tells the clients the port
that it listens to, the client initiates the data connection
connectint to that port.  For the LVS/TUN and the LVS/DR,
LinuxDirector is only on the client-to-server half connection, so it
is imposssible for LinuxDirector to get the port from the packet that
goes to the client directly.</p>

<p>SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is an example of a protocol that has
connection affinity between a given client and a particular server.
When a SSL connection is made, port 443 for secure Web servers and
port 465 for secure mail server, a key for the connection must be
chosen and exchanged. The later connections from the same client are
granted by the server in the life span of the SSL key.</p>

<h1>Persistent Port Solution</h1>

<p>Our current solution to connection affinity is to add persistent
port feature in LVS. In the persistent port, when a client first
accesses the service, LinuxDirector will create a connection template
between the given client and the selected server, then create an entry
for the connection in the hash table. The template expires in a
configurable time, and the template won't expire until all its
connections expire. The connections for any port from the client will
send to the server before the template expires. The timeout of
persistent templates can be configured by users, and the default is
300 seconds.</p>

<p>Here is some information about the implementation of persistent
port feature. For persistent ftp service, the template is created in
the form like &lt;cip, 0, vip, 0, rip, 0&gt;, where cip is client IP
address, vip is virtual IP address and rip is real server IP
address. Then, ftp data connection for any port can be caught. For
other persistent services, the template is created in the form like
&lt;cip, 0, vip, vport, rip, rport&gt;, which grants that any
connection from the same client for the persistent service will be
sent to the same server, but different persistent services is
irrelavant.</p>

<p>Although the persistent port may lead to slight load imbalance
among servers, it is a good solution to connection affinity.</p>

<h1>Persistent Granularity</h1>

<p>In the persistent port feature by default, we have assumed that
persistent granularity is per client. However, here is some
application scenerios that we need persistent granularity is larger
than per client. For example, we want to build a persistent service
based on the LVS cluster, but some ISPs use the non-persistent proxy
servers, which means that connections from the same clients will be
sent to the different proxy servers. In the default, LinuxDirector
will treat them from the different client and sent them to different
servers, then the clients behind the non-persistent proxy servers
cannot access our persistent service.</p>

<p>Here we use some conjesture to solve this problem. We assume that
non-persistent proxy servers are often located in the same network,
for example the network netmask is 255.255.255.0. We add the
persistent netmask into persistent services. The client source address
is masked with this netmask for the purpose of creating and accessing
the templates, then all clients within the peristent netmask will
access the same server. The default persistent mask is
255.255.255.255, which means that the persistent granularity is per
client.

<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>The following is some configuration example related to
persistence.</p>

<h2>1. Sticky http example of LVS/NAT</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>ipvsadm -A -t virtualdomain:www -p<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:www -R 192.168.1.2 -m<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:www -R 192.168.1.3 -m<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:www -R 192.168.1.4 -m</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>2. FTP example of LVS/NAT</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>ipvsadm -A -t virtualdomain:ftp -p 540<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:ftp -R 192.168.1.2 -m<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:ftp -R 192.168.1.3 -m<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:ftp -R 192.168.1.4 -m</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>3. Sticky http example of LVS/TUN</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>ipvsadm -A -t virtualdomain:www -p<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:www -R 192.168.1.2 -i<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:www -R 192.168.1.3 -i<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:www -R 192.168.1.4 -i</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>4. FTP example of LVS/DR</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>ipvsadm -A -t virtualdomain:ftp -p 540<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:ftp -R 192.168.1.2 -g<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:ftp -R 192.168.1.3 -g<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:ftp -R 192.168.1.4 -g</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>5. Catch-all persistence example of LVS/DR</h2>

<p>In some applications, all servers run the same two or more
services, it requires that once a clients access one server of a
server, all connections for other services from the same client must
be sent to the same server in the specified time. We can use the port
zero here to catch all persistent services, the configuration commands
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>ipvsadm -A -t virtualdomain:0 -p<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:0 -R 192.168.1.2 -g<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:0 -R 192.168.1.3 -g<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:0 -R 192.168.1.4 -g</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>6. Persistent granularity example</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>ipvsadm -A -t virtualdomain:www -p -M 255.255.255.0<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:www -R 192.168.1.2<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:www -R 192.168.1.3<br>
    ipvsadm -a -t virtualdomain:www -R 192.168.1.4</p>
</blockquote>
