<P>
<P>There are some tools to help you configure an LVS.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Gui for VS-DR lvs-gui http://www.us.vergenet.net/linux/lvs-gui.
This only sets up a VS-DR LVS and is awaiting further work.
</LI>
<LI>configure script for
all LVS types which does sanity checking on setup but which
doesn't handle director failover
</LI>
<LI>Ultra Monkey which handles director failover, but 
has to be setup by hand.</LI>
</UL>
<P>A recent survey of production LVS's 
(by Lorn Kay <CODE>lorn_kay@hotmail.com</CODE>, results on the 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/survey/survey_2000101.html">LVS website</A>)
showed that 10 out of 19 were setup
by methods described as "other", ie they didn't use any of the scripts
on the LVS website. Clearly the above scripts are not regarded as production
quality by our users.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Configure</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>(The section in the LVS-mini-HOWTO may be more recent than this.)
<P>The configure script that reads a conf file and
sets up VS-DR, VS-NAT, VS-Tun, with single or multi-NIC machines
using regular ethernet devices or transparent proxy to accept
packets. Elementary checks are done on routing and connectivity
and the script has always produced a working LVS when no errors
are reported. (I haven't tried it with any deliberately pathological
cases).
<P>The output is a well commented rc.lvs and rc.mon 
file to run at bootup (or when you're setting up an LVS).
<P>The script is in the Software section of the website and
will have a name like configure-x.x-lvs.tar.gz.
<P>The script does not handle director failover.
<P>The configure script detects the kernel version of the director
(for old versions of ipvs/kernels) and is run on the director. 
The resulting rc.lvs (and rc.mon) files are run on the director
and then the real-servers (the configure files/directory nfs exported 
to the real-servers, where I run the same rc.lvs file to configure 
the real-servers). The rc.lvs file knows whether it's running on a 
director or real-server. After setup, the network connections 
neccessary to export this directory can be removed.
<P>Running the script on the real-servers after it
is run on the director allows the rc.lvs script to check the
connections to the now configured director. Running the rc.lvs
script on the real-server first will achieve the same result, but
you will get error messages, and won't know if it succeeded even if
it did.
<P>Pick an appropriate template conf file (lvs_nat.conf,
lvs_tun.conf or lvs_dr.conf) for the mode you are operating the
LVS under (VS-NAT, VS-Tun or VS-DR respectively) and edit the
IPs and services for your situation. The files come preconfigured
for telnet as the service. This is the simplest service
for initial tests: the client is readily available and on
connection, the login prompt will tell you which server you have
connected to. Use round robin scheduling, so that you will
connect to each server in turn, confirming that they are all
working.
<P>Other services can be added by uncommenting/adding or editing the
entries in the example *.conf files. The *.conf files give
suggested IP's (192.168.1.x/24, 10.1.1.x/24) for the various
machines.
<P>For those that don't like to debug disasters from trivial mistakes, 
the configure script will use either the name (eg telnet) or
port (eg 23) of the service in the *.conf file, using the
/etc/services file to translate one to another. Likely additions
needed to your /etc/services will be
<P>
<PRE>
ftp-data        20/tcp
ssh             22/tcp
domain          53/tcp  nameserver      dns #the string "dns" needs to be added here
domain          53/ucp  nameserver      dns #and here
shell           514/tcp cmd             rsh #add rsh here
https           443/tcp
https           443/udp
printer         515/tcp spooler         lpd #add the string "lpd" here
nfs             2049/udp        nfs
mysql           3306/tcp
mysql           3306/udp
netpipe         5002/tcp
</PRE>
<P>In several instances, a machine will need multiple IPs. You can
put multiple IP's on a single NIC with IP aliasing (an option
when building the kernel) - just enter the aliased interface (eg
eth0:12) for that IP into the *.conf file.
<P>run the configure script
<P>$ ./configure.pl lvs_nat.conf
<P>This produces an rc.lvs_xxx script (eg rc.lvs_nat, rc.lvs_tun,
rc.lvs_dr), and a mon_xxx.cf script. (After testing put rc.lvs_xxx into
/etc/rc.d or /etc/init.d and put mon_xxx.cf in /etc/mon)
<P>Run the rc.lvs script on the director and then the real-servers with 
the command
<P>$ . ./rc.lvs_dr
<P>or possibly (if you get weird errors, eg it doesn't detect correctly whether 
it's running on a director or a real-server - this happens on my 2.0.36 real-server)
<P>$sh rc.lvs_dr
<P>The rc.lvs script -
<P>
<UL>
<LI>adds ethernet devices and routes to director, real-servers (including non-Linux)</LI>
<LI>checks connections with fping.</LI>
<LI>runs ipchains </LI>
<LI>turns ipforwarding on (VS-NAT) or off (VS-DR, VS-Tun)</LI>
<LI>turns off icmp redirects (VS-NAT)</LI>
<LI>adds services with ipvsadm.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The rc.lvs script does not -
<P>
<UL>
<LI>know about director failover. It assumes there is only one director.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Check the output from ipvsadm, ifconfig -a and netstat -rn on the
director and then the real-server(s), to see that the 
services/IP's are correct. If not re-edit and re-run the script(s).
<P>
<H3>Test with telnet</H3>

<P>
<P>Telnet is a non-persistent service (in the http sense, rather than the LVS sense)
and will allow you to check that all real-servers are present (you'll
get the login prompt from each real-server in turn).
<P>Check that the service(s) are running on each server at the IP of
the VIP (use netstat -an). Some services (eg telnet listen to
0.0.0.0, ie to all IPs on a machine).
<P>If there are no errors on running the rc.lvs_xxx script, then
telnet from the client to the VIP (here 192.168.1.110). You will
be routed through to one of the real-servers and you will get the
login prompt (and real name) of a real-server and can login.
<P>On the director look at the output of ipvsadm, you should see a
connection to a real-server on port:23.
<P>On the real-server do
<P>$ netstat -an | grep 23
<P>and look for connections to the telnet port.
<P>Logout and telnet again to the VIP. You will get the login prompt
from the next real-server.
<P>
<H3>Test with something else eg http</H3>

<P>
<P>Edit lvs_nat.conf activating http, rerun configure.pl and rerun
the new rc.lvs_nat files.
<P>http:
Point your browser to the VIP http://192.168.1.110.  You will get
the DocumentRoot of one of the real-servers. Open another copy of 
the browser and connect again. You should get the other server 
(this will be easier to see if the webpages are different). Look 
at the output of ipvsadm on the director for connections to the httpd 
ports, and on the server look at the output from netstat -an | grep 80 
(or 8080 if you are running VS-NAT and have remapped the ports) for connections.
<P>If your httpd is persistent (in the http sense), 
you will/may connect to the same website each time.
