<P>
<P>If initial connection to your service (telnet, ftp, sendmail...) is delayed
by 10secs..5mins, but after you connect everything is fine, then you have
problems with identd.
<P>Since problems with identd affect many aspects of an LVS, there are
references to identd in several places in this document. 
I haven't worked out a way of collecting them all together yet,
so best search with your editor for authd/identd.
<P>There are two parts to identd on your servers
<UL>
<LI>Identd runs on your real-servers. 
You don't care about this. 
Identd is for clients on your real-servers 
connecting to services on remote machines.
You aren't using this when setting up an LVS.
(However if you telnet from your real-servers for some other reason,
you'll need to think about what identd is doing.)</LI>
<LI>your LVS'ed services <EM>may</EM> ask the identd client on your
server to connect to the identd on the client machine 
and ask for the identity of the person
connecting to the service on the real-server. 
You don't want this. 
In general there is no way for the reply to return to the real-server
in an LVS.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The problem is in the second part, <EM>i.e.</EM> if the LVS'ed service
on the real-server asks for the ident client to connect to the identd
on the client. (This may be a little confusing, machines can be clients
and servers at the same time.)
<P>Here's a example telnet connection through a director to a real-server where 
telnetd is running inside tcpwrappers. 
tcpwrappers uses the ident client on the remote host (the
one with the telnetd) to connect to 
the identd on the local (telnet client) host.

<H2><A NAME="ss16.1">16.1 What is authd/identd?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>identd is a demon run under inetd. 
Other services running on the server can use identd to ask the client
machine for the identity of the user making the request.
When a request arrives at a server for such a service (e.g. telnet, sendmail),
the auth client will connect from a high port to client:auth asking
"who is the owner of the process requesting this service".
If the client's authd replies with a <CODE>username@nodename</CODE>, the reply
will be optionally logged on the server (eg to syslog) and the
connection request will be handed back to telnetd (or whichever service). 
If the reply is "<CODE>root@nodename</CODE>", or some null reply, or there is
no authd on the client, then the server's authd will wait till
a timeout before allowing connection. The delay is about 10secs for
Slackware and 2mins for RedHat7.0. There is no checking of the
validity of the reply and since the reply is under control of
the client machine, the reply <CODE>username@nodename</CODE> could be bogus.
<P>The authd is a security feature. However it doesn't get the
server very much (you don't know who has made the connect request,
only what they told you), while clients that fail are delayed. This
may only be a nuisance for people telnet'ing in (provided they understand
what's happening), but will bring mail delivery to a crawl.
<P>If you setup an LVS with real-servers that have services running inside
identd, you will have to deal with identd.
Any service in inetd running under tcpwrappers 
(probably just about every service, if tcpwrappers is installed) 
and sendmail (see section on sendmail) use it.

</PRE>
<P>4.5)  What is Identd?  Can I disable it?
<P>Identd identifies the username of a process owning a specific TCP/IP connection.
It is usually run via inetd and listens on port 113.
Identd should not be used as a method of authentication - 
anyone with root access can alter their identd response.
Indeed, on many systems (such as FreeBSD and Windows) 
even a non-privledged user can specify whatever identd response they want.
The protocol is most useful on multiuser systems as a method of tracking down problem users.
If one of your users is causing problems on another system, 
that system's admin can inform you of the username of 
the specific user causing problems, saving you a lot of legwork.
Should you run identd? That's really a judgement call.
On systems with many users, the benefits could be great, 
but it doesn't serve any particular purpose on a single user box.
Not running identd may limit your ability to connect to certain servers - 
many IRC and some FTP servers don't allow, or severly restrict, 
non-identd'd connections, for example.
However, running it means leaving a service open to the outside world, 
with all the security risks that entails.
Another thing to consider is that identd can allow 
attackers to find out valuable information about your system, 
such as whether a certain service is running as root, 
the operating system you are running, 
and the usernames of your users.
Consider running identd with the -n flag, 
which sends userid numbers instead of usernames.
See the identd manpage and /etc/identd.conf for more 
information about the available options.
You can block access to identd by shutting it off entirely 
(usually done via inetd, see section on disabling services), 
or by using tcpwrappers and/or firewalling software to disable/restrict access.
If you need identd enabled in order to connect to a certain server, 
you might want to consider allowing access to it only from that server.
If you do choose to firewall the identd port, 
strongly consider using a reject policy rather than deny.
Using deny may greatly increase the time it takes 
you to connect to servers that utilize identd, 
as they will wait for a response of some type before allowing you to connect.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss16.3">16.3 Why identd is a problem for LVS</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The problem is that the identd/authd client makes a callback from the
VIP (for VS-DR, VS-Tun) or the RIP (for VS-NAT) and the LVS doesn't know
about it. For the simple case where clients call from the RIP see the section on
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-20.html#clients_on_real-servers">running clients on real-servers</A>.
There the client is independant of the LVS. 
There you will see solutions when there are easy solutions.
<P>The case of clients on the real-servers making call backs 
triggered by an LVS client's requests to an LVS'ed service is
more difficult as the result has to get back to the LVS'ed service. 
<P>Normally in an LVS, the director in an LVS responds to connect requests by handing
them to an arbitrary real-server. 
The corrollary of this is that replies to a client request initiated on a real-server, 
to the outside world, 
will not return to the real-server unless something is done to handle it. 
(The only solutions we have are those in the section on
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-20.html#clients_on_real-servers">running clients on real-servers</A>.)
<P>
<UL>
<LI>replies from the LVS client machine,
arriving at the director are not connect requests, 
and will not belong to an established connection.
They will be dropped.</LI>
<LI>even if the director could forward these replies to a real-server, 
they could go to any real-server, and not neccessarily to the real-server
which originated the request.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The result is that the client request will hang or timeout.

<P>Problem: In the case of identd, the smtpd on a real-server says to
identd "give me the name of the owner of the process on IP:port

on the RIP rather than the VIP and, as is most likely, RIP is not
routable from the outside world, mail on the real-server will
hang. If identd is running on the VIP, then replies will probably
return to another real-server and mail will still hang.
<P>The converse case, of sending mail from the LVS, has the smtp
server out in internetland asking the LVS for the name of the
owner of the process running on the VIP sending him mail.  If
identd is clustered, then the request will in all probability go
to another real-server. This seems equally intractable at the

<P>The Ident, or auth port on the client machine trying to connect
back to the vserver is where it will pause for about 10-15
seconds then connect just fine. I believe this may be qmail
specific since a server funning sendmail will not have this
problem and ident seems to be used by qmail more than it or
something.

Check if your system (tcpwrapper or sendmail) is doing a NS
lookup before accepting the connection or trying to connect to
ident.

From: Chris Kennedy &lt;tt/ckennedy@iland.net/
Subject: Re: SMTP -- very slow connection
</PRE>
<P>I had the same problem with the Direct Routing and SMTP and POP3.
It looked like a problem with the Ident lookup to the server by
the client, it was what always was occurring during that time out
period.  I saw this while doing tcpdumps on the virtual server
where the client would just keep asking for Ident lookups to the
Virtual IP address which are from the client port 113 to a random
port above 1023 on the virtual server.  I can see how this is
tricky with the direct routing method since this traffic should
be sent on to the real server but is not.  I sort of gave up on
Direct Routing for now since this looks pretty hard to fix if it
really is Ident and the client requirements getting in the way.

Great idea. That was it. I turned off ident in sendmail and
things worked fine.
<P>However, I don't want to turn of ident in sendmail, and I figure
other things might want ident too... so I want to cluster ident.
<P>Clustering ident didn't help. I clustered tcp port 113 to both
servers. (I even tried "loadbalancing" 25 and 113 just to ONE
server -- that way it'd always hit the same server)... And that
didn't work. I got the same results -- telnet to port 25...
connect... thirty seconds... and then sendmail would enter
command mode.
<P>Any ideas? Do I have to loadbalance anything else besides tcp 113
for identd to work?
<P>Would like to add more info here...
<P>Why is identd run with smtp (any other reason other than
wanting to know who is sending me the mail?)
<P>do you have to turn identd off in smtp to get LVS smtp to work?
<P>has anyone LVS'ed identd? (I'd imagine you wouldnt
neccessarily get the ident from the same machine running the process for
which you want the ident)
<P>anything else?
