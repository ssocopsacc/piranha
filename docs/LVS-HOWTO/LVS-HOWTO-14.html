<P>
<P>(We rarely hear of anyone using this.)
<P>The director machine can be a real-server too. This is convenient
when only a small number of machines are available as servers.
<P>To use this feature, add a real-server with IP 127.0.0.1 (or a
local IP on your director) to your lvs_xxx.conf file, rerun the
configure script, and reinstall the rc.lvs_xxx files.
<P>You will need to setup the service to listen to the VIP on the
director. Some services, eg telnet listen on all IP's on the
machine and you won't have to do anything special for them.
Other services, eg http have to be specifically configured to
listen to each IP. You are _not_ connecting to a service on
127.0.0.1 despite what this instruction might look like.
<P>LocalNode operates independantly of NAT,TUN or DR modules.

<P>(Wensong)
For the LocalNode feature, the load balancer just lets the
packets pass to the upper layer (up to service daemon) to process
the request. So, the port number of the local service must be
equal to that of the virtual service, otherwise it won't work.
Maybe I should add some code to check whether the port number of
local service is equal to that of virtual service, if not, reject
it to avoid such an error.
<P>Testing LocalNode
<P>If you want to explore installing localnode by hand, try this.
First make sure scheduling is turned on at the director (this
command adds round robin scheduling and direct routing)
<P>$ipvsadm -A -t 192.168.1.110:23 -s rr
<P>With an httpd listening on the VIP (192.168.1.110:80) of the
director (192.168.1.1) AND with _no_ entries in the ipvsadm
table, the director appears as a normal non-LVS node and you can
connect to this service at 192.168.1.110:80 from an outside
client. If you then add an external real-server to the ipvsadm
table in the normal manner with
<P>/sbin/ipvsadm -a -t 192.168.1.110:80 -r 192.168.1.2
<P>then connecting to 192.168.1.110:80 will display the webpage at
the real-server 192.168.1.2:80 and not the director. This is
easier to see if the pages are different (eg put the real IP of
each machine at the top of the webpage).
<P>Now comes the LocalNode part -
<P>You can now add the director back into the ipvsadm table with
<P>/sbin/ipvsadm -a -t 192.168.1.110:80 -r 127.0.0.1
<P>(or replace 127.0.0.1 by another IP on the director)
<P>Note, the port is the same for LocalNode. LocalNode is
independant of the LVS mode (VS-NAT/Tun/DR) that you are using
for the other IP:ports.
<P>Shift-reloading the webpage at 192.168.1.110:80 will alternately
display the wepages at the server 192.168.1.2 and the director at
192.168.1.1 (if the scheduling is unweighted round robin). If you
remove the (external) server with
<P>/sbin/ipvsadm -d -t 192.168.1.110:80 -r 192.168.1.2
<P>you will connect to the LVS only at the directors port.  The
ipvsadm table will then look like
<PRE>
Protocol Local Addr:Port ==>
                        Remote Addr           Weight ActiveConns TotalConns
                        ...
TCP      192.168.1.110:80 ==>
                        127.0.0.1             2      3           3
</PRE>
<P>From the client, you cannot tell whether you are connecting
directly to the 192.168.1.110:80 socket or through the LVS code.
