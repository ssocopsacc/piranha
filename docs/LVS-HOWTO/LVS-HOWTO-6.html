<P>You can setup a working LVS from the LVS-mini-HOWTO. Presumably
it will be more upto date, clearer and simpler than this section.

<H3>2.2.x kernels</H3>

<P>
<P>(with suggestions from John Cronin <CODE>jsc3@havoc.gtf.org</CODE>)
<P>Get a fresh kernel from ftp.kernel.org and the matching
ipvs patch from the software page on www.linuxvirtualserver.org.
Apply the kernel patch 2.2.x using the instructions in the tarball. 
You'll do something like
<P>director:/usr/src/linux# patch -p1 &lt;../ipvs-0.9.8-2.2.14/ipvs-0.9.8-2.2.14.patch
<P>(Note: kernels from RedHat are not the standard kernels off
ftp.kernel.org. They are pre-patched with ipvs. 
If you are going to use RedHat files, follow RedHat's
instructions, not ours. If you follow our instructions 
and try to patch a RH kernel you'll get
<P>

</PRE>
<P>The pre-applied patch on the 
RedHat kernel will likely be older than the one
on the LVS website.)
<P>Compile the 2.2.x kernel and reboot.
<P>The actual kernel compile instructions will vary with
kernel patch number. Here's what I used for ipvs-0.9.9 on
kernel 2.2.15pre9 in the Networking options. The relevant
options are marked. Some of the options are not explicitely
required for LVS to work, but you'll need them anyhow - e.g.
ip aliasing if you need to constuct a director with only
one NIC, or tunneling if you are going to run VS-Tun. Until
you know what you're doing activate all of the options with
an '*' at the start of the line.
<P>You need to turn on "Prompt for developmental code... " or 
whatever under the "Code Maturity" section.
In the "Networking" section, you have to turn on 
IP:masquerading before you get the ipvs option. 
<P>Do all the other kernel stuff - make modules, install the modules, 
copy the new kernel into / or /boot, edit lilo.conf and run lilo. 
Make sure you leave the old kernel config in lilo too, so you can
recover if all does not go well. When loading the new kernel,
make sure the ip_vs* modules get loaded. 
The README in the kernel source tree has all the necessary info in there.

<P>The default LVS 
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-18.html#Hash_Table">hash table</A>
size (2^12 entries) originally meant 2^12 simultanous connections. 
If you are editing the .config by hand look for CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_VS_TAB_BITS. 
Each entry (for a connection to a client)
takes 128 bytes, 2^12 entries requires 512kbytes. 
If you have 128M spare memory you can have 10^6 entries 
if you set the table size to 2^20. 
(Note: not all connections are active - some are waiting to timeout). 
<P>Early versions of ipvs would crash your machine if you alloted too much 
memory to this table. This problem has been fixed in 0.9.9. (Note "top" 
reports memory allocated, not memory you are using. No matter how much 
memory you have, Linux will eventually allocate all of it as you continue to run
the machine and load programs.)
<P>As of ipvs-0.9.9 the hash table is different.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From: Julian Anastasov <CODE>uli@linux.tu-varna.acad.bg</CODE><P>
<P>With CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_VS_TAB_BITS we specify not the max
number of the entries (connections in your case) but the number of the
rows in a hash table. This table has columns which are unlimited. You can
set your table to 256 rows and to have 1,800,000 connections in
7000 columns average. But the lookup is slower. The lookup function
chooses one row using hash function and starts to search all these
7000 entries for match. So, by increasing the number of rows we want
to speedup the lookup. There is _no_ connection limit. It depends on the
free memory. Try to tune the number of rows in this way that the
columns will not exceed 16 (average), for example. It is not fatal if
the columns are more (average) but if your CPU is fast enough this is not
a problem.
<P>
<P>All entries are included in a table with (1 &lt;&lt; IP_VS_TAB_BITS)
rows and unlimited number of columns. 2^16 rows is enough. Currently,
LVS 0.9.7 can eat all your memory for entries (using any number of rows).
The memory checks are planned in the next LVS versions (are in 0.9.9?).

The default timeout value for TCP session is 15 minutes, TCP session after 
receiving FIN is 2 miniutes, and UDP session 5 minutes. You can use 
"ipchains -M -S tcp tcpfin udp" to set your own time values.

Actually, the column 8 is the delta value in sequence numbers. The

<H3>2.4.x kernels</H3>

<P>
<P>The patches to the early versions of the 2.4.x kernels were configured and
installed separately to the "make menuconfig" for the kernel. This
required moving files into the /lib/modules directories and loading
the modules by hand.
<P>To avoid this, you should start with 0.2.7-2.4.2 (there were two versions,
the hand install and the version which is configured by "make configure";
get the 2nd one).

<H3>The LVS code does not swap</H3>

<P>
<P>Joe Feb 2001: 
With sufficient number of connections, a director could
start to swap out its tables (is this true?)
<P>In this case, throughput could slow to a crawl. I presume
the kernel would have to retrieve parts of the table to find
the real-server associated with incoming packets. I would
think in this case it would be better to drop connect
requests than to accept them.
<P>In earlier verions of LVS, you could set the amount of
memory for the tables (in bytes). Now you allocate a number
of hashes, whose size could (in the worst case) grow without limit.
<P>Julian
<P>
<PRE>
> IMO, this is not true. LVS uses GFP_ATOMIC kind of allocations
> and as I know such allocations can't be swapped out.
</PRE>
<P>If it's possible for LVS to start the director to swap,
is there some way to stop this?
<P>
<PRE>
> You can try with testlvs whether the LVS uses swap.
> Start the kernel with LILO option mem=8M and with large swap area.
> Then check whether more than 8MB swap is used.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Real-servers</A>
</H2>

<P> 
<P>In general, nothing specific is done for the real-servers.
You can have any OS running on them 
(except VS-Tun, which runs only on Linux real-servers). 
You plug them in to the network, startup the services on the 
VIP (for VS-DR, VS-Tun) or the RIP (VS-NAT), setup the default
gw (the router and the director respectively in the usual setups) 
and you're ready to go.
<P><EM>Except:</EM> You have to handle the 
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-3.html#arp_problem">arp problem</A>
with VS-DR (and possibly VS-Tun). 
Unfortunately this turns what would be a trivial installation into
one that requires clear thinking. 
If you don't want to deal with the arp problem for your first installation,
then setup a VS-NAT LVS.
<P>Eventually you'll want the higher throughput and lower latency of VS-DR,
in which case you'll need to understand the arp problem.
The simplest approach is to use the NOARP option of ifconfig to setup lo:0 on
non-linux unix real-servers. 
For linux, 
<UL>
<LI>2.0.x kernels: the NOARP option to ifconfig works as for other unices</LI>
<LI>2.2.x recent (<EM>i.e.</EM>x&gt;12) kernels; activate arp hiding </LI>
<LI>2.4.x kernels; patch the kernel with Julian's "hidden patch"
and then activate the arp hiding</LI>
</UL>
<P>For non-unix (ie Windows) real-servers, look below for further instructions. 
<P>
<H3>Linux Real-servers</H3>

<P>
<P>If you are handling the arp problem by hiding the VIP device on the real-servers,
then you need to patch the real-servers if
<UL>
<LI>2.2.x (where x&lt;12) </LI>
<LI>2.4.x (all versions, see info about 
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-3.html#2.4_arp">patching 2.4 real-servers</A>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The current version(s) of 2.2.x, <EM>e.g.</EM> 2.2.19 
are already patched with the arp hiding code 
<EM>i.e.</EM> you don't have to patch the current 2.2.x kernels.
For Linux-2.0.x real-servers, you can use the NOARP option when 
setting up a device for the VIP.

<P>Some unices aren't very cooperative and other methods (<EM>e.g.</EM>
adding an extra NIC) should do it.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
in most cases (when using the NOARP option) 
you need alias support.
Some Unices have no support for aliased interfaces or only
limited, such as QNX, Aegis or Amoeba for example. Others
have interface flag inheritance problems like HP-UX where
it is impossible to give an aliased interface a different
flag vector as for the underlying physical interface
(as happens with Linux 2.2 and 2.4 - Joe). So 
for HP/UX you need a special setup because with the standard
depicted setup for DR it will NOT work.
I've done most
Unices as Realserver and was negatively astonished by all 
the different implementation variations of the different
Unix flavours. This maybe resulted from unclear statements
from the RFC's.

<H3>NT</H3>

<P>
<P>(This is not handled by the configure script).
<P>Here's Wensong's recipe for setting up the lo device on a NT real-server.
<P>If you don't have MS Lookback Adapter Driver installed on
your NT boxes, enter Network Control Panel, click the
Adapter section, click to add a new adapter, select the
MS Loopback Adapter. Your NT cdrom is needed here.
<P>Then add your VIP (Virtual IP) address on the MS Loopback
Adapter, do not enter a gateway address on the Loopback
Adapter. Since the netmask 255.255.255.255 is considered
invalid in M$ NT, you just accept the default netmask,
then enter MS-DOS prompt, remove the extra routing entry.
<P>
<PRE>
         
        c:route delete &lt;VIP's network> &lt;VIP's netmask>
</PRE>
<P>This will make the packets destined for this network will
go through the other network interface, not this MS Loopback
interface.
<P>As I remember, setting its netmask to 255.0.0.0 also works.
<P>alternatively (Jerome RICHARD <CODE>jrichard@virtual-net.fr</CODE>)
<P>On Windows NT Server, you just have to install a network adapter
called "MS Loopback" (Provided on the Windows NT CDROM in new
network section) and then you setup the VIP on this interface.

</H2>

<P>
<P>ipchains in 2.2.x kernels has been replaced by iptables in 2.4.x kernels.
For 2.4 kernels, ipchains is available for backwards compatibility.
However ipchains and iptables can't be used at the same time.
<P><EM>The ip_tables module is incompatible with ipchains. 
If present, the ip_tables module must be unloaded for ipchains to work.</EM> 
<P>If you have ip_tables loaded, 
you'll get uninformative errors when you try to run ipchains commands with 2.4.
Rather than saying that ipchains under 2.4 is there for compatibility,
it would be more accurate to say that the ipchains commands available with 2.4 kernels
will only cause you grief and it will be faster to rewrite your scripts to 
iptables, than to fall into all the holes you'll find using the compatibility.
It won't take long before some script/program expects to run ip_tables on your
2.4 machine and as soon as that happens one or both (I don't know which) 
of your iptables or ipchains are hosed.
