Go to the "software" link. Get the latest patch tarball for the 
director (available in 2.2.x and 2.4.x flavors).
This will contain the kernel patch and source code for various
programs and utilities.

<P>
<P>You have to patch the standard kernel with the matching ipvs patch.
<P>
<P>The director operates in one (or several) forwarding methods; VS-NAT (network
address translation); VS-DR (direct routing) and VS-Tun
(tunneling). 
The mode is chosen individually for each real-server/service
by ipvsadm.
<P>
<P>The director code is well tested on Intel. As well several people
are running on Alpha hardware (Flavio Pescuma
<CODE>edtfopa@malmen.ericsson.se</CODE> on a mailserver, and Philip Copeland
<CODE>copeland@redhat.com</CODE> who is using it alongside an Intel director
to test director failover).
<P>
<P>You have to edit the code to run it on Alpha: from Philip
(this has been fixed in recent code).

        (you are using VS-DR or VS-Tun on the director)
        AND
        (you are running a Linux 2.2.x, 2.4.x kernel on a real-server)
        AND
        (       
                the VIP on the real-server is on an ethernet device eg lo:0, tunl0:0
                i.e. is not being accepted by transparent proxy
        )
        AND 
        (
                the real-servers can answer arp requests from
                the client/router (the real-servers are on the same
                piece of wire|network as the director)
        )

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>The most common way to handle the arp problem is to hide the VIP from arp requests
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-3.html#2.2_arp">2.2.x: use the prepatched 2.2.x kernel in the standard distribution for the real-server</A> </LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-3.html#2.4_arp">2.4.x: patch the standard 2.4.x kernel for the real-server</A>. </LI>
</UL>
<P>Although not used very much (I don't know why), another simple method
is to put an extra NIC into the real-servers for the VIP and not connect it
to the network. The NIC doesn't handle any packets, it's just a way
of putting the VIP onto the real-server. 
The NIC can be an old 10Mbps ISA card.
The cost of some 100Mbps PCI tulip cards now is less than the salary
you'd pay for the time to recompile a 2.4.x kernel with the hidden patch.
<P>All methods of handling the arp problem work, have about the same 
performance (throughput, latency) and are about equally easy/difficult
to setup. 
<P>The method of hiding the devices from arp requests is the closest
to the standard NOARP unix behaviour and is the method most commonly
used on Linux real-servers.

<H2><A NAME="configure"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Configure Script</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>You can set up the LVS by hand with ipvsadm. This is somewhat tedious
and error prone. While do-able for a single LVS configuration,
this is not the way to go for setting up lots of different
LVS configurations. Some 
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-9.html#configure">configure</A>
tools are available.
<P>The configure script  
was designed to set up LVS's quickly so I could do testing.
The current version (0.8) does a wide range of checks, hopefully
catching the usual errors. 
This only sets up a single director and cannot handle director failover. 
For director failover try 
<A HREF="http://ultramonkey.sourceforge.net/">Ultra Monkey</A>. 
The configure script uses mon to handle failure of services
on real-servers.
