<P>
<P>Transparent proxy is a piece of Linux kernel code (2.2.x, 2.4.x) 
which allows a packet destined for an IP _not_ on the host, to
be accepted locally, as if the IP was on the host.
<P>Note: web caches (proxies) can operate in transparent mode,
when they cache all IP's on the internet. 
In this mode, requests are received and transmitted without 
changing the port numbers (ie port 80 in and port 80 out).
In a normal web cache, the clients are asked to reconfigure
their browsers to use the proxy, some_IP:3128. 
It is difficult to get clients to do this, and the
solution is transparent caching. 
This is more difficult to setup, but all clients will
then use the cache.
<P>In the web caching world, transparent caching is often 
called &quot;transparent proxy&quot; because it is 
implemented with transparent proxy. 
In the future, it is conceivable that transparent web caching will be implemented
by another feature of the tcpip layer and it would be nice 
if functionality of transparent web caching had a name
separate from the command that is used to implement it. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1 General</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This is Horms' (<CODE>horms@vergenet.net</CODE>) method (now called the
transparent proxy or TP method). 
It uses the transparent proxy feature of ipchains to accept packets with dst=VIP 
by the host (director or real-servers) when it doesn't 
have the IP (eg the VIP) on a device. 
It can be used on the real-servers 
(where it handles the 
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-3.html#arp_problem">arp problem</A>) 
or the director to accept packets for the VIP. 
When used on the director, TP
allows the director to be the default gw for VS-DR 
(see 
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-12.html#martian">Julian's martian modification</A>).
<P>Unfortunately the 2.2 and 2.4 versions of transparent proxy 
are as different as chalk and cheese in an LVS. 
Presumably the functionality has been maintained for
for transparent web caching but the effect on LVS has not
been considered.
<P>You can use transparent proxy for
<UL>
<LI>2.2.x, director and real-servers</LI>
<LI>2.4.x, real-servers only</LI>
</UL>
<P>(Historical note from Horms:)
From memory I was getting a cluster ready for a demo at Inetnet World, New
York which was held in October 1999. The cluster was to demo all sorts of
services that Linux could run that were relevant to ISPs. Apache, Sendmail,
Squid, Bind and Radius I believe. As part of this I was playing with LVS-DR
and spotted that the real servers coulnd't accept traffic for the VIP. I
had used Transparent Proxying in the past so I tried it and it worked.
That cluster was pretty cool, it took me a week to put it together
and it was an ISP in an albeit very large box.
<P>Transparent proxy is only implemented in Linux.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 2.2.x you need IP masquerading, transparent proxing and IP firewalls turned on.</LI>
<LI> 2.4.x, TP is a standard part of the kernel build, there is no separate TP option.
In the netfilter options, there are the options under &quot;Full NAT (NEW)&quot; MASQUERADE,
REDIRECT. I suspect you need all these.</LI>

<P>This is a demonstration of TP using 2 machines: a server (which will accept packets by TP)

This is incorporated into the configure script.

#This code is part of the Linux Virtual Server project
#http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org
#
#
#Horm's method for solving the LVS arp problem for a VS-DR LVS.
#Uses ipchains to redirect a packet destined for an external
#machine (in this case the VIP) to the local device.

#-----------------------------------------------------
#Instructions:
#
#1. Director: Setup normally (eg turn on LVS services there with ipvsadm).
#2. Real-servers: Must be running 2.2.x kernel.
# 2.1 recompile the kernel (and reboot) after turning on the following under "Networking options"
#       Network firewalls
#       IP: firewalling
#       IP: transparent proxy support
#       IP: masquerading
# 2.2 Setup the real-server as if it were a regular leaf node on the network,
#      ie with the same gateway and IP as if it were in the LVS, but DO NOT
#      put the VIP on the real-server. The real-server will only have its regular IP
#      (called the RIP in the HOWTO).
#3. Edit "user configurable" stuff below"
#4. Run this script
#-----------------------------------------------------
#user configurable stuff

IPCHAINS="/sbin/ipchains"
VIP="192.168.1.110"

#services can be represented by their name (in /etc/services) or a number
#SERVICES is a quote list of space separated strings
# eg SERVICES="telnet"
#    SERVICES="telnet 80"
#    SERVICES="telnet http"
#Since the service is redirected to the local device,
#make sure you have SERVICE listening on 127.0.0.1
#
SERVICES="telnet http"
#
#----------------------------------------------------

#turn on IP forwarding (off by default in 2.2.x kernels)

<P>Transparent proxy for 2.2.x kernels is installed with ipchains. 
<P>For 2.4.x kernels transparent proxy is built on netfilter 
and is installed with iptables 
(you need iptables support in the kernel and the ip_tables module must be loaded). 
The ip_tables module is incompatible with the ipchains module 
(which in 2.4.x is available for compatibility with scripts written for 2.2.x kernels). 
If present, the ipchains module must be unloaded.

<P>This works fine for the real-server allowing it to accept packets for the
VIP, without having the VIP on an ethernet device (eg lo, eth0). 
If you do the same on the director,
setup for an LVS with (say) telnet forwarded in the ipvsadm tables, 
then the telnet connect request from the client is accepted 
by the director, rather than forwarded by ipvs to the real-servers 
(tcpdump sees a normal telnet login to the director). 
Apparently ipchains is sending the packets
to a place that ipvs can't get at them.

<P>(Julian)
<P>I haven't tried tproxy in 2.4 but in theory it can't work.
The problem is that netfilter implements tproxy by mangling the
destination address in the prerouting. LVS requires from the tproxy
implementation only to deliver the packet locally and not to alter
the header. So, I assume LVS detects the packets with daddr=local_addr
and refuses to work.
<P>Netfilter maintains a sockopt SO_ORIGINAL_DST that can be
used from the user processes to obtain the original dest addr/port
before they are mangled in the pre routing nat place. This can be used
from the squids, for example, to obtain these original values.
<P>If LVS wants to support this broken tproxy in netfilter we
must make a lookup in netfilter to receive the original dst and then
again to mangle (for 2nd time) the dst addr/port. IMO, this is very
bad and requires LVS always to require netfilter nat because it will
always depend on netfilter: LVS will be compiled to call netfilter
functions from its modules.
<P>So, the only alternative remains to receive packets with
advanced routing with fwmark rules. There is one problem in 2.2 and
2.4 when the tproxy setups must return ICMP to the clients (they
are internal in such setup), for example, when there is no real server
LVS returns ICMP DEST_UNREACH:PORT_UNREACH. In this case both kernels
mute and don't return the ICMP. icmp_send() drops it. I contacted
Alexey Kuznetsov, the net maintainer, but he claims there are more
such places that must be fixed and "ip route add table 100 local
0/0 dev lo" is not a good command to use. But in my tests
I don't have any problems, only the problem with dropped ICMP
replies from the director.
<P>So, for TP, I'm not sure if we can support it in the
director. May be it can work for the real servers and even when
the packet is mangled I don't expect peformance problems but who
knows.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="TP_QandA"></A> <A NAME="ss15.4">15.4 Transparent proxy Q&amp;A</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Q. How does a packet get to the host which is accepting packets for the VIP
if the host doesn't have the VIP on an eth device to respond to arp requests?  
<P>A. You have to send it there. 
<P>On the real-servers in a VS-DR LVS this is already handled for you. 
In VS-DR when the director wants to send a packet to a real-server, 
it looks up the MAC address for the RIP and sends the packet with addresses 
CIP->VIP by linklayer to the MAC address of the real-server. 
Once the packet arrives at the real-server, processes listening to VIP:port 
pick up the packet. 
<P>As pointed out by Julian, you can put a transparent proxy IP onto any host, 
so you can use transparent proxy to put the VIP onto the director if you like
(for 2.2.x kernels). 
To receive the packet for the VIP, the director has to be the default gw 
for the network in the incoming router's table (or the router needs a host 
route for the VIP to the director). 
<P>The same problem exists when 
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-8.html#routing_fwmark">accepting packets with fwmark</A>.
<P>Q. Some demons listen only to specific IPs. What IP is the telnet/httpd 
listening to when it accepts a connection by transparent proxy?
<P>A. It depends where you are when you make the connect request (this is for 2.2.x kernels). 
<P>example:
<P>You are on the console of a host and add x.x.x.111:http by transparent
proxy and setup the httpd to listen to x.x.x.111:80. 
You cannot ping x.x.x.111. To connect to x.x.x.111:http you need to
<P># route add -host 192.168.1.111 lo
<P>(adding a route to eth0 does not work).
<P>If you go to an outside machine, you still cannot ping x.x.x.111 and you
cannot connect to x.x.x.111:http unless you make the target box the default gw

<P>If you now go back to the console of the transparent proxy machine and
change the httpd to listen to 127.0.0.1:http (and not to x.x.x.111:http)
you can still connect to x.x.x.111:http even though nothing is listening to that
IP:port (linux tcpip does local delivery to local IPs). 
(You can also connect to 127.0.0.1:http, but this is not concerned with
transparent proxy.)
<P>Returning to the outside machine, you cannot connect to x.x.x.111:http.
<P>The connections from the outside machine model connections to the director
with the VIP by transparent proxy, while the connections from the console
model the real-server which has a packet delivered from the director.
On the real-server you could have your services listening to 127.0.0.1
rather than the VIP. You may run into DNS problems (see 
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-10.html#indexing">Running  indexing programs</A>) if the process listening to 127.0.0.1 doesn't know that
it's answering to lvs.domain.org.

<P>Evidently TP on the real-server is making the real-server think that the packets
arrived on the RIP, hence the authd call is made from the RIP.
<P>As it happens in my test setup, the client can connect directly to the RIP.
(In a VS-DR LVS, the client doesn't exchange packets with the RIP, 
so I haven't blocked this connection. 
In production, the router would not allow these packets to pass). 
Since the authd packets are between the RIP and CIP,
the authd exchange can proceed to completion.

was tested by varying the IP (localhost, RIP or VIP)
that the httpd listens to on the real-servers. 
At the same time the base address of the web page was
changed to be the same as the IP that the httpd was listening to.
The nodes on each network link

<P>Some of these connections are problematic. 
The client in a VS-DR LVS isn't supposed to be getting packets from the RIP.
What is happening is 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the httpd on the real-server is listening on the RIP </LI>
<LI>the base address of the webpage is the RIP</LI>
<LI>an incoming request from the client to the VIP will retrieve a webpage
with references to gif etc that are at the RIP</LI>
<LI>the client will then ask for the gifs from the RIP.</LI>
<LI>in the above setup that I use for testing, the client does not request packets from the RIP.</LI>
<LI>in the above setup, the client can connect to the RIP directly (this will not be allowed in a production server, either the router will prevent the connection, or the RIP will be a non-routable IP).</LI>
<LI>the client retrieves the gifs and the rest of the page directly from the real-server</LI>
</UL>
<P>The way to prevent this is to remove the route on the client to the RIP network
(eg see 
<A HREF="LVS-HOWTO-12.html#Pearthree">removing routes not needed for VS-DR</A>).
Doing so when the httpd is listening to the RIP and the base address is the
RIP causes the browser on the client to hang. 
This shows that the client is really retrieving packets directly
from the RIP.
Changing the base address of the
webpage back to the VIP allows the webpage to be delivered to the client,
showing that the client is now retrieving packets by making requests to the
VIP via the director.
<P>It would seem then that with 2.4 TP, the real-server is receiving packets on the
RIP, rather than the VIP as it does with 2.2 TP. With a service listening to only
1 port (eg httpd) then the httpd has to
<P>
<UL>
<LI>listen on the RIP</LI>
<LI>the addresses on the webpage have to be for the VIP</LI>
</UL>
<P>The client will then ask for the webpage at the VIP. 
The real-server will accept this request on the RIP and return
a webpage full of references to the VIP (eg gifs). 
The client will then ask for the gifs from the VIP.
The real-server will accept the requests on the RIP and return
the gifs.

<P>See the

for discussion and sample graphs of hits/sec
for http servers. Hits/sec can increase to high levels as the payload
decreases in size. While large numbers for hits/sec may be impressive,
they only indicate one aspect of a web server's performance. If large
(> 1 packet) files are transferred/hit or computation is involved,
then hits/sec is not a useful measure of web performance.

<P>The revival of Horms' posting, which I overlooked a month ago, was
a lifesaver for us. We had a monster load distribution problem, and 
spread 4 virtual IP numbers across 10 'real' boxes (running Roxen, 
a fantastic web platform). The ipchains-REDIRECT feature works perfectly, 
without any of that arp aggravation! A PII_450 held up just fine at 
20 megabits/s of HTTP -REQUEST- TRAFFIC!
