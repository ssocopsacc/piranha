NAME
send_arp tool to notify network of a new IP address / MAC address mapping
SYNOPSIS
send_arp takes the supplied data and sends it out as an arp broadcast
on the specified network device. This tool is mostly used by software
(such as piranha) that manipulates virtual IP addresses and needs to
notify the network that the device servicing an IP address has changed.
"send_arp [-i "ARG"] old-ip-addr old-mac-addr new-ip-addr new-mac-addr"


DESCRIPTION
send_arp sends out an arp broadcast on the specified network
device (defaults to eth0), reporting an old and new IP address mapping
to a MAC address. This is most useful in situations involving virtual
IP addresses, where the network device servicing that address has changed,
and other network arp caches need to be notified about it. All the data
is specified in the command line and is simply passed along in an arp
message frame.
Since the old and new data specified can contain the same information, this
tool can also be used to refresh arp caches or send periodic broadcasts.

send_arp simply takes the specified arguments and places them in
an ethernet arp broadcast. is a daemon used by pulse to monitor the running status of
the specified services on clustered servers.  This tool has NO error checking
and should not be run without the direct supervision of pulse!
 
OPTIONS

"-i" ARG
Optional. Indicates the network device to send the arp broadcast on. If
omitted, the program defaults to eth0.

"old-ip-addr"
The original IP address (specified in nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn format) that
the MAC address specified in "old-mac-addr" had mapped to it.

"old-mac-addr"
The MAC address that was servicing the IP address specified in "old-ip-addr".
The MAC address is specified in hex, and can be formatted
with or without colon (":") separators.

"new-ip-addr"
The new IP address (specified in nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn format) that
the MAC address specified in "new-mac-addr" now has mapped to it.

"new-mac-addr"
The MAC address that is now servicing the IP address specified in
"new-ip-addr". The MAC address is specified in hex, and can be formatted
with or without colon (":") separators.
