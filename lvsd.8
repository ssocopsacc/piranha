LVS 8 "Thu Feb 03 2005"

NAME
lvsd - daemon to control the Red Hat clustering services. 
SYNOPSIS
lvsd [-c cfgfile|--configfile=cfgfile] [-n|--nodaemon]
[--nofork] [-t|--test-start] [-?|--help] [--usage] [--version]
DESCRIPTION
lvsd reads in the cluster configuration file lvs.cf, calls 
ipvsadm to maintain the IPVS routing table, and nanny to perform 
monitoring services.

lvsd is normally started by pulse although it can be run as a command line
tool. Similarly, the configuration file that tells lvsd what to do is normally
edited by piranha, but it can be manually edited.

All activity from lvsd is logged to syslog (when lvsd is
running as a daemon).
OPTIONS

"-c "cfgfile "|--configfile=" cfgfile
Normally, lvsd uses lvs.cf as its configuration file, but this
can be overridden and another file can be used.
"-n|--nodaemon"
Normally, lvsd runs as a daemon, however using this option, lvsd
runs in the foreground.  When running in this mode, all its output is sent to
STDOUT instead of syslog.
"--nofork"
Don't fork, but do perform disassociate.
"-t|--test-start"
Running lvsd is test mode allows the user to monitor what lvsd would
actually do.  This is only useful during debugging.
"-?|--help"
Shows a verbose usage listing.
"--usage"
Outputs a terse argument summary.
"--version"
Displays program version.
